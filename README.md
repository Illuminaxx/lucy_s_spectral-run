#### Spectral Run – Gleam Game Jam 2025

Spectral Run is a psychedelic fast-paced runner made with Gleam + Paint + Tiramisu, created for the Gleam Game Jam 2025.

Inspired by the theme “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”, the game blends neon tunnels, spectral color-shifting and hypnotic movement.


### Concept

You control a spectral runner sliding through a neon tunnel.
Three spectral states — Red, Green, Blue — define what you can phase through.

### Goal

Switch your spectre color to safely pass through matching obstacles

Collect diamonds for points

Survive as long as possible, as speed continuously ramps up

Simple controls, high speed, intense color-driven decision making.

### Tech Stack

Spectral Run is built entirely with Gleam and minimal JavaScript glue.
